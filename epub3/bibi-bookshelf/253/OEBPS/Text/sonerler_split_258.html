  <p class="normal">They that have power to hurt and will do none,</p>

  <p class="normal">That do not do the thing they most do show,</p>

  <p class="normal">Who moving others are themselves as stone,</p>

  <p class="normal">Unmovèd, cold, and to temptation slow;</p>

  <p class="normal">They rightly do inherit heaven’s graces,</p>

  <p class="normal">And husband nature’s riches from expense;</p>

  <p class="normal">They are the lords and owners of their faces,</p>

  <p class="normal">Others but stewards of their excellence.</p>

  <p class="normal">The summer’s flower is to the summer sweet,</p>

  <p class="normal">Though to itself it only live and die;</p>

  <p class="normal">But if that flow’r with base infection meet,</p>

  <p class="normal">The basest weed outbraves his dignity:</p>

  <p class="normal">For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;</p>

  <p class="normal">Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.</p>
