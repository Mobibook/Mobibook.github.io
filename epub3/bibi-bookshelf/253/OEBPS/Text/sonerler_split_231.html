  <p class="normal">Ah, wherefore with infection should he live</p>

  <p class="normal">And with his presence grace impiety,</p>

  <p class="normal">That sin by him advantage should achieve</p>

  <p class="normal">And lace itself with his society?</p>

  <p class="normal">Why should false painting imitate his cheek</p>

  <p class="normal">And steal dead seeming of his living hue?</p>

  <p class="normal">Why should poor beauty indirectly seek</p>

  <p class="normal">Roses of shadow since his rose is true?</p>

  <p class="normal">Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,</p>

  <p class="normal">Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins,</p>

  <p class="normal">For she hath no exchequer now but his,</p>

  <p class="normal">And proud of many, lives upon his gains?</p>

  <p class="normal">O him she stores, to show what wealth she had</p>

  <p class="normal">In days long since, before these last so bad.</p>
