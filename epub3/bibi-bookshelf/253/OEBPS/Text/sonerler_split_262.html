  <p class="normal">From you have I been absent in the spring,</p>

  <p class="normal">When proud pied April, dressed in all his trim,</p>

  <p class="normal">Hath put a spirit of youth in everything,</p>

  <p class="normal">That heavy Saturn laughed and leapt with him.</p>

  <p class="normal">Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell</p>

  <p class="normal">Of different flowers in odour and in hue,</p>

  <p class="normal">Could make me any summer’s story tell,</p>

  <p class="normal">Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew.</p>

  <p class="normal">Nor did I wonder at the lily’s white,</p>

  <p class="normal">Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;</p>

  <p class="normal">They were but sweet, but figures of delight</p>

  <p class="normal">Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.</p>

  <p class="normal">Yet seemed it winter still and, you away,</p>

  <p class="normal">As with your shadow I with these did play.</p>
