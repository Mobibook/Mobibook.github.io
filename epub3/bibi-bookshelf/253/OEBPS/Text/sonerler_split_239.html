  <p class="normal">So are you to my thoughts as food to life,</p>

  <p class="normal">Or as sweet seasoned showers are to the ground;</p>

  <p class="normal">And for the peace of you I hold such strife</p>

  <p class="normal">As ’twixt a miser and his wealth is found;</p>

  <p class="normal">Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon</p>

  <p class="normal">Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;</p>

  <p class="normal">Now counting best to be with you alone,</p>

  <p class="normal">Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure;</p>

  <p class="normal">Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,</p>

  <p class="normal">And by and by clean starvèd for a look;</p>

  <p class="normal">Possessing or pursuing no delight</p>

  <p class="normal">Save what is had or must from you be took.</p>

  <p class="normal">Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,</p>

  <p class="normal">Or gluttoning on all, or all away.</p>
