  <p class="normal">Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,</p>

  <p class="normal">Bound for the prize of all too precious you,</p>

  <p class="normal">That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,</p>

  <p class="normal">Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?</p>

  <p class="normal">Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write</p>

  <p class="normal">Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?</p>

  <p class="normal">No, neither he, nor his compeers by night</p>

  <p class="normal">Giving him aid, my verse astonishèd.</p>

  <p class="normal">He, nor that affable familiar ghost</p>

  <p class="normal">Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,</p>

  <p class="normal">As victors of my silence cannot boast;</p>

  <p class="normal">I was not sick of any fear from thence.</p>

  <p class="normal">But when your countenance filled up his line,</p>

  <p class="normal">Then lack’d I matter; that enfeebled mine.</p>
