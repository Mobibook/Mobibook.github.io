  <p class="normal">Lo, in the orient when the gracious light</p>

  <p class="normal">Lifts up his burning head, each under eye</p>

  <p class="normal">Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,</p>

  <p class="normal">Serving with looks his sacred majesty;</p>

  <p class="normal">And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,</p>

  <p class="normal">Resembling strong youth in his middle age,</p>

  <p class="normal">Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,</p>

  <p class="normal">Attending on his golden pilgrimage:</p>

  <p class="normal">But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,</p>

  <p class="normal">Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,</p>

  <p class="normal">The eyes (’fore duteous) now converted are</p>

  <p class="normal">From his low tract, and look another way:</p>

  <p class="normal">So thou thyself out-going in thy noon,</p>

  <p class="normal">Unlook’d on diest unless thou get a son.</p>
