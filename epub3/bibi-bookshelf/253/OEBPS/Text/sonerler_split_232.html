  <p class="normal">Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,</p>

  <p class="normal">When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,</p>

  <p class="normal">Before these bastard signs of fair were borne,</p>

  <p class="normal">Or durst inhabit on a living brow;</p>

  <p class="normal">Before the golden tresses of the dead,</p>

  <p class="normal">The right of sepulchres, were shorn away</p>

  <p class="normal">To live a second life on second head;</p>

  <p class="normal">Ere beauty’s dead fleece made another gay.</p>

  <p class="normal">In him those holy antique hours are seen</p>

  <p class="normal">Without all ornament, itself and true,</p>

  <p class="normal">Making no summer of another’s green,</p>

  <p class="normal">Robbing no old to dress his beauty new:</p>

  <p class="normal">And him as for a map doth Nature store,</p>

  <p class="normal">To show false Art what beauty was of yore.</p>
