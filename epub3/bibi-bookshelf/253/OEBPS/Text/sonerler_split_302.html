  <p class="normal">When my love swears that she is made of truth</p>

  <p class="normal">I do believe her, though I know she lies,</p>

  <p class="normal">That she might think me some untutored youth</p>

  <p class="normal">Unlearnèd in the world’s false subtleties.</p>

  <p class="normal">Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,</p>

  <p class="normal">Although she knows my days are past the best,</p>

  <p class="normal">Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:</p>

  <p class="normal">On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.</p>

  <p class="normal">But wherefore says she not she is unjust?</p>

  <p class="normal">And wherefore say not I that I am old?</p>

  <p class="normal">Oh, love’s best habit is in seeming trust,</p>

  <p class="normal">And age in love loves not to have years told.</p>

  <p class="normal">Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,</p>

  <p class="normal">And in our faults by lies we flattered be.</p>
