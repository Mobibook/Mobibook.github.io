  <p class="normal">If thou survive my well contented day,</p>

  <p class="normal">When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,</p>

  <p class="normal">And shalt by fortune once more re survey</p>

  <p class="normal">These poor rude lines of thy deceasèd lover,</p>

  <p class="normal">Compare them with the bettering of the time,</p>

  <p class="normal">And though they be outstripped by every pen</p>

  <p class="normal">Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,</p>

  <p class="normal">Exceeded by the height of happier men.</p>

  <p class="normal">O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Had my friend’s Muse grown with this growing age,</p>

  <p class="normal">A dearer birth than this his love had brought</p>

  <p class="normal">To march in ranks of better equipage;</p>

  <p class="normal">But since he died, and poets better prove,</p>

  <p class="normal">Theirs for their style I’ll read, his for his love.’</p>
