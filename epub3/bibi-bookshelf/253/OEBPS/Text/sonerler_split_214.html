  <p class="normal">How heavy do I journey on the way,</p>

  <p class="normal">When what I seek (my weary travel’s end)</p>

  <p class="normal">Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,</p>

  <p class="normal">‘Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.’</p>

  <p class="normal">The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,</p>

  <p class="normal">Plods dully on to bear that weight in me,</p>

  <p class="normal">As if by some instinct the wretch did know</p>

  <p class="normal">His rider loved not speed being made from thee.</p>

  <p class="normal">The bloody spur cannot provoke him on</p>

  <p class="normal">That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,</p>

  <p class="normal">Which heavily he answers with a groan</p>

  <p class="normal">More sharp to me than spurring to his side;</p>

  <p class="normal">For that same groan doth put this in my mind:</p>

  <p class="normal">My grief lies onward and my joy behind.</p>
