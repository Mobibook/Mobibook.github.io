  <p class="normal">The little Love-god lying once asleep</p>

  <p class="normal">Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,</p>

  <p class="normal">Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep</p>

  <p class="normal">Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand</p>

  <p class="normal">The fairest votary took up that fire</p>

  <p class="normal">Which many legions of true hearts had warmed,</p>

  <p class="normal">And so the general of hot desire</p>

  <p class="normal">Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.</p>

  <p class="normal">This brand she quenchèd in a cool well by,</p>

  <p class="normal">Which from love’s fire took heat perpetual,</p>

  <p class="normal">Growing a bath and healthful remedy</p>

  <p class="normal">For men diseased. But I, my mistress’ thrall,</p>

  <p class="normal">Came there for cure; and this by that I prove;</p>

  <p class="normal">Love’s fire heats water, water cools not love.</p>
