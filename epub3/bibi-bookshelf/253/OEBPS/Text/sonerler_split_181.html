  <p class="normal">Who will believe my verse in time to come</p>

  <p class="normal">If it were filled with your most high deserts?</p>

  <p class="normal">Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb</p>

  <p class="normal">Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.</p>

  <p class="normal">If I could write the beauty of your eyes,</p>

  <p class="normal">And in fresh numbers number all your graces,</p>

  <p class="normal">The age to come would say, ‘This poet lies;</p>

  <p class="normal">Such heavenly touches ne’er touched earthly faces.’</p>

  <p class="normal">So should my papers, yellow’d with their age,</p>

  <p class="normal">Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,</p>

  <p class="normal">And your true rights be termed a poet’s rage</p>

  <p class="normal">And stretched metre of an antique song.</p>

  <p class="normal">But were some child of yours alive that time,</p>

  <p class="normal">You should live twice – in it and in my rhyme.</p>
