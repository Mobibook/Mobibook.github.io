  <h2 class="h2baslik1" id="calibre_toc_305">CXLVII</h2>

  <p class="normal">My love is as a fever, longing still</p>

  <p class="normal">For that which longer nurseth the disease,</p>

  <p class="normal">Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,</p>

  <p class="normal">The uncertain sickly appetite to please.</p>

  <p class="normal">My reason, the physician to my love,</p>

  <p class="normal">Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,</p>

  <p class="normal">Hath left me, and I desperate now approve</p>

  <p class="normal">Desire is death, which physic did except.</p>

  <p class="normal">Past cure I am, now reason is past care,</p>

  <p class="normal">And frantic mad with evermore unrest;</p>

  <p class="normal">My thoughts and my discourse as madmenâ€™s are,</p>

  <p class="normal">At random from the truth, vainly expressed:</p>

  <p class="normal">For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,</p>

  <p class="normal">Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.</p>
