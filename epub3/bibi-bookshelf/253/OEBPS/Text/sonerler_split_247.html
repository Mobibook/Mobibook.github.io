  <p class="normal">I never saw that you did painting need,</p>

  <p class="normal">And therefore to your fair no painting set;</p>

  <p class="normal">I found –or thought I found– you did exceed</p>

  <p class="normal">The barren tender of a poet’s debt:</p>

  <p class="normal">And therefore have I slept in your report,</p>

  <p class="normal">That you yourself, being extant, well might show</p>

  <p class="normal">How far a modern quill doth come too short,</p>

  <p class="normal">Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.</p>

  <p class="normal">This silence for my sin you did impute,</p>

  <p class="normal">Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;</p>

  <p class="normal">For I impair not beauty, being mute,</p>

  <p class="normal">When others would give life and bring a tomb.</p>

  <p class="normal">There lives more life in one of your fair eyes</p>

  <p class="normal">Than both your poets can in praise devise.</p>
