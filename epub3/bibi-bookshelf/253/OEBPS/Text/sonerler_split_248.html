  <p class="normal">Who is it that says most, which can say more</p>

  <p class="normal">Than this rich praise – that you alone are you,</p>

  <p class="normal">In whose confine immured is the store</p>

  <p class="normal">Which should example where your equal grew?</p>

  <p class="normal">Lean penury within that pen doth dwell</p>

  <p class="normal">That to his subject lends not some small glory;</p>

  <p class="normal">But he that writes of you, if he can tell</p>

  <p class="normal">That you are you, so dignifies his story.</p>

  <p class="normal">Let him but copy what in you is writ,</p>

  <p class="normal">Not making worse what nature made so clear,</p>

  <p class="normal">And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,</p>

  <p class="normal">Making his style admirèd everywhere.</p>

  <p class="normal">You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,</p>

  <p class="normal">Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.</p>
