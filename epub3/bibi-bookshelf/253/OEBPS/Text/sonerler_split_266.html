  <p class="normal">My love is strengthened, though more weak in seeming;</p>

  <p class="normal">I love not less, though less the show appear:</p>

  <p class="normal">That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming</p>

  <p class="normal">The owner’s tongue doth publish everywhere,</p>

  <p class="normal">Our love was new, and then but in the spring,</p>

  <p class="normal">When I was wont to greet it with my lays;</p>

  <p class="normal">As Philomel in summer’s front doth sing,</p>

  <p class="normal">And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:</p>

  <p class="normal">Not that the summer is less pleasant now</p>

  <p class="normal">Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,</p>

  <p class="normal">But that wild music burthens every bough,</p>

  <p class="normal">And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.</p>

  <p class="normal">Therefore, like her, I sometime hold my tongue</p>

  <p class="normal">Because I would not dull you with my song.</p>
