  <p class="normal">So is it not with me as with that Muse,</p>

  <p class="normal">Stirr’d by a painted beauty to his verse,</p>

  <p class="normal">Who heaven itself for ornament doth use</p>

  <p class="normal">And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,</p>

  <p class="normal">Making a couplement of proud compare</p>

  <p class="normal">With sun and moon, with earth and sea’s rich gems,</p>

  <p class="normal">With April’s first born flowers and all things rare</p>

  <p class="normal">That heaven’s air in this huge rondure hems.</p>

  <p class="normal">O, let me, true in love, but truly write,</p>

  <p class="normal">And then believe me, my love is as fair</p>

  <p class="normal">As any mother’s child, though not so bright</p>

  <p class="normal">As those gold candles fixed in heaven’s air.</p>

  <p class="normal">Let them say more that like of hearsay well;</p>

  <p class="normal">I will not praise that purpose not to sell.</p>
