  <p class="normal">Like as to make our appetites more keen,</p>

  <p class="normal">With eager compounds we our palate urge;</p>

  <p class="normal">As to prevent our maladies unseen,</p>

  <p class="normal">We sicken to shun sickness when we purge:</p>

  <p class="normal">Even so, being full of your neâ€™er cloying sweetness,</p>

  <p class="normal">To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;</p>

  <p class="normal">And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness</p>

  <p class="normal">To be diseased ere that there was true needing.</p>

  <p class="normal">Thus policy in love, to anticipate</p>

  <p class="normal">The ills that were not, grew to faults assured,</p>

  <p class="normal">And brought to medicine a healthful state</p>

  <p class="normal">Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:</p>

  <p class="normal">But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,</p>

  <p class="normal">Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.</p>
