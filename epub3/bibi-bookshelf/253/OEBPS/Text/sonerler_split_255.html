  <p class="normal">Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,</p>

  <p class="normal">Some in their wealth, some in their body’s force,</p>

  <p class="normal">Some in their garments, though new fangled ill,</p>

  <p class="normal">Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;</p>

  <p class="normal">And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure</p>

  <p class="normal">Wherein it finds a joy above the rest.</p>

  <p class="normal">But these particulars are not my measure;</p>

  <p class="normal">All these I better in one general best.</p>

  <p class="normal">Thy love is better than high birth to me,</p>

  <p class="normal">Richer than wealth, prouder than garments’ cost,</p>

  <p class="normal">Of more delight than hawks or horses be;</p>

  <p class="normal">And having thee of all men’s pride I boast:</p>

  <p class="normal">Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take</p>

  <p class="normal">All this away and me most wretched make.</p>
