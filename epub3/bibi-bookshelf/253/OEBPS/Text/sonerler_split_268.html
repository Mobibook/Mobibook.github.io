  <p class="normal">To me, fair friend, you never can be old,</p>

  <p class="normal">For as you were when first your eye I eyed</p>

  <p class="normal">Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold</p>

  <p class="normal">Have from the forests shook three summers’ pride;</p>

  <p class="normal">Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned</p>

  <p class="normal">In process of the seasons have I seen,</p>

  <p class="normal">Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,</p>

  <p class="normal">Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green.</p>

  <p class="normal">Ah, yet doth beauty like a dial hand</p>

  <p class="normal">Steal from his figure and no pace perceived,</p>

  <p class="normal">So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,</p>

  <p class="normal">Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived,</p>

  <p class="normal">For fear of which hear this, thou age unbred:</p>

  <p class="normal">Ere you were born was beauty’s summer dead.</p>
