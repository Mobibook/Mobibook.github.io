  <p class="normal">I went to the Garden of Love.</p>

  <p class="normal">And saw what I never had seen:</p>

  <p class="normal">A Chapel was built in the midst,</p>

  <p class="normal">Where I used to play on the green.</p>

  <p class="normal">And the gates of this Chapel were shut,</p>

  <p class="normal">And Thou shalt not, writ over the door;</p>

  <p class="normal">So I turnâ€™d to the Garden of Love,</p>

  <p class="normal">That so many sweet flowers bore,</p>

  <p class="normal">And I saw it was filled with graves,</p>

  <p class="normal">And tomb-stones where flowers should be:</p>

  <p class="normal">And Priests in black gowns, were walking their rounds,</p>

  <p class="normal">And binding with briars, my joys &amp; desires.</p>
