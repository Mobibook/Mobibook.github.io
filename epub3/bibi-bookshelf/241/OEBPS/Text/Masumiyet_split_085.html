  <h2 class="solbaslik" id="calibre_toc_44">A Little Boy Lost</h2>

  <p class="normal">Nought loves another as itself</p>

  <p class="normal">Nor venerates another so,</p>

  <p class="normal">Nor is it possible to Thought</p>

  <p class="normal">A greater than itself to know:</p>

  <p class="normal">And Father, how can I love you,</p>

  <p class="normal">Or any of my brothers more?</p>

  <p class="normal">I love you like the little bird</p>

  <p class="normal">That picks up crumbs around the door.</p>

  <p class="normal">The Priest sat by and heard the child,</p>

  <p class="normal">In trembling zeal he siez’d his hair:</p>

  <p class="normal">He led him by his little coat:</p>

  <p class="normal">And all admir’d the Priestly care.</p>

  <p class="normal">And standing on the altar high,</p>

  <p class="normal">Lo what a fiend is here! said he:</p>

  <p class="normal">One who sets reason up for judge</p>

  <p class="normal">Of our most holy Mystery.</p>

  <p class="normal">The weeping child could not be heard,</p>

  <p class="normal">The weeping parents wept in vain:</p>

  <p class="normal">They strip’d him to his little shirt,</p>

  <p class="normal">And bound him in an iron chain.</p>

  <p class="normal">And burn’d him in a holy place,</p>

  <p class="normal">Where many had been burn’d before:</p>

  <p class="normal">The weeping parents wept in vain.</p>

  <p class="normal">Are such things done on Albions shore.</p>
