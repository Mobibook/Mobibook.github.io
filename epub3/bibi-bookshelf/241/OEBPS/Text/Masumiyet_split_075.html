  <p class="normal">Dear Mother, dear Mother, the Church is cold.</p>

  <p class="normal">But the Ale-house is healthy &amp; pleasant &amp; warm:</p>

  <p class="normal">Besides I can tell where I am use’d well.</p>

  <p class="normal">Such usage in heaven will never do well.</p>

  <p class="normal">But if at the Church they would give us some Ale,</p>

  <p class="normal">And a pleasant fire, our souls to regale:</p>

  <p class="normal">We’d sing and we’d pray all the live-long day:</p>

  <p class="normal">Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then the Parson might preach &amp; drink &amp; sing,</p>

  <p class="normal">And we’d be as happy as birds in the spring:</p>

  <p class="normal">And modest dame Lurch, who is always at Church,</p>

  <p class="normal">Would not have bandy children nor fasting nor birch.</p>

  <p class="normal">And God like a father rejoicing to see,</p>

  <p class="normal">His children as pleasant and happy as he:</p>

  <p class="normal">Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the Barrel</p>

  <p class="normal">But kiss him &amp; give him both drink and apparel.</p>
