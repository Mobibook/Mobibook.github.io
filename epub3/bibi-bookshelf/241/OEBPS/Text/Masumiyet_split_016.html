  <p class="normal">When my mother died I was very young,</p>

  <p class="normal">And my father sold me while yet my tongue,</p>

  <p class="normal">Could scarcely cry weep weep weep weep.</p>

  <p class="normal">So your chimneys I sweep &amp; in soot I sleep.</p>

  <p class="normal">Theres little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head</p>

  <p class="normal">That curl’d like a lambs back, was shav’d, so I said,</p>

  <p class="normal">Hush Tom never mind it, for when your head’s bare,</p>

  <p class="normal">You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.</p>

  <p class="normal">And so he was quiet, &amp; that very night,</p>

  <p class="normal">As Tom was a sleeping he had such a sight,</p>

  <p class="normal">That thousands of sweepers Dick, Joe, Ned &amp; Jack</p>

  <p class="normal">Were all of them lock’d up in coffins of black,</p>

  <p class="normal">And by came an Angel who had a bright key,</p>

  <p class="normal">And he open’d the coffins &amp; set them all free.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then down a green plain leaping laughing they run</p>

  <p class="normal">And wash in a river and shine in the Sun.</p>

  <p class="normal">Then naked &amp; white, all their bags left behind,</p>

  <p class="normal">They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind.</p>

  <p class="normal">And the Angel told Tom, if he’d be a good boy,</p>

  <p class="normal">He’d have God for his father &amp; never want joy.</p>

  <p class="normal">And so Tom awoke and we rose in the dark</p>

  <p class="normal">And got with our bags &amp; our brushes to work.</p>

  <p class="normal">Tho’ the morning was cold, Tom was happy &amp; warm.</p>

  <p class="normal">So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.</p>
