  <h2 class="solbaslik" id="calibre_toc_8">The Little Black Boy</h2>

  <p class="normal">My mother bore me in the southern wild,</p>

  <p class="normal">And I am black, but O! my soul is white,</p>

  <p class="normal">White as an angel is the English child:</p>

  <p class="normal">But I am black as if bereav’d of light.</p>

  <p class="normal">My mother taught me underneath a tree</p>

  <p class="normal">And sitting down before the heat of day,</p>

  <p class="normal">She took me on her lap and kissed me,</p>

  <p class="normal">And pointing to the east began to say.</p>

  <p class="normal">Look on the rising sun: there God does live</p>

  <p class="normal">And gives his light, and gives his heat away.</p>

  <p class="normal">And flowers and trees and beasts and men recieve</p>

  <p class="normal">Comfort in morning joy in the noon day.</p>

  <p class="normal">And we are put on earth a little space,</p>

  <p class="normal">That we may learn to bear the beams of love.</p>

  <p class="normal">And these black bodies and this sun-burnt face</p>

  <p class="normal">Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove.</p>

  <p class="normal">For when our souls have learn’d the heat to bear</p>

  <p class="normal">The cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice,</p>

  <p class="normal">Saying: come out from the grove my love &amp; care,</p>

  <p class="normal">And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.</p>

  <p class="normal">Thus did my mother say and kissed me.</p>

  <p class="normal">And thus I say to little English boy.</p>

  <p class="normal">When I from black and he from white cloud free,</p>

  <p class="normal">And round the tent of God like lambs we joy:</p>

  <p class="normal">Ill shade him from the heat till he can bear,</p>

  <p class="normal">To lean in joy upon our fathers knee.</p>

  <p class="normal">And then I’ll stand and stroke his silver hair,</p>

  <p class="normal">And be like him and he will then love me.</p>
